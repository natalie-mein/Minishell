## Project overview

The project is a part of the [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/curriculum) core curriculum. **Minishell** is simple Shell (Unix interface) written in C that uses Bash (Bourne Again SHell) as a reference. The program supports both interactive and non-interactive modes, command history, built-in commands and external executables, and manage POSIX signals. Minishell uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree to process user input, supporting complex command chains.
This project was developed by [Helena Utzig](https://github.com/hlntzg) and [Natalie Meintjes](https://github.com/Arcane-Jill) as part of the 42 core curriculum.

## Features

#### Interface: 
Provides an interactive command-line prompt using the readline library.
Shows a custom prompt with program name and current working path.
Maintains a command history for easy navigation and reuse.

#### Signal Handling:
The minishell properly responds to key signals:
- `Ctrl-C`: In interactive mode, pressing Ctrl-C displays a new prompt without terminating the shell. In non-interactive mode, it interrupts a running process.
- `Ctrl-D`: In interactive mode, Ctrl-D signals the end of input and exits the shell. In non-interactive mode, it is treated as an End-Of-File (EOF) signal, terminating input.
- `Ctrl-\`: When used in interactive mode, this signal is ignored. However, in non-interactive mode, it forces the termination of the running process.

#### Process user input:
Detects common syntax errors, such as unclosed quotes. 
Handles both single (`'`) and double (`"`) quoted strings.
Tokenizes commands using special characters such as `|`, `<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`, and strings.
Expands environment variables (`$VAR`).
Supports $? for retrieving the exit status of the last foreground command.

#### Execute command line:
Minishell first processes here-documents before executing commands. It manages file descriptors for input and output redirection, ensuring proper data flow. Command execution follows, with inter-process communication handled through pipes by managing the write-end and read-end.

**Piping and Redirection**

Allows chaining commands by redirecting the output of one process to another using pipes (`|`).
Redirects input (`<`) from a file or implements here-document (`<<`), reading input until a specified delimiter is reached.
Redirects output (`>`) to a file (overwrites existing content) or appends output (`>>`) to a file.
Supports multiple redirections and here-documents, combined or not with pipes, following bash as a reference. 

**Built-in Commands**

Built-in commands are executes directly within the shell, following the convention of returning 0 on success and a non-zero value on failure (accessible via $?). Each built-in receives an array of strings as arguments and the corresponding file descriptor when dealing with redirection to outfile. As a simple command, it is executed in the parent process; when it is part of a pipeline, as a child processing.

**Supported built-ins**

- `echo` – Prints text to the terminal (supports `-n` to omit newline).
- `cd` – Changes the current working directory (supports relative and absolute paths).
- `pwd` – Displays the current working directory.
- `export` – Sets environment variables.
- `unset` – Removes environment variables.
- `env` – Prints the current environment variables.
- `exit` – Exits the shell (support none or only one numeric argument)

**External Commands**

The shell executes external commands by searching for the executable in directories specified by the PATH variable. If no executable was found, a specific error message is displayed and exit status is updated, following bash as a reference. 
Execution process:
1. Creates a new process using `fork()`.
2. Searches for the command in the `PATH`.
3. Executes the command with `execve()`.

## Installation

### What do I need to install Minishell?

To successfully install and run this project, you should have: 

- **Unix-like Operation System**, such as Linux or macOS.
- **C compiler** (e.g. gcc). You can install it using your package manager if not already available.
- **Make Utility**. Make sure `make` is installed to run the `Makefile` provided for compilation.

### How to get and compile the program?

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:** First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine and change into the project directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hlntzg/minishell.git && cd minishell/
```

2. **Compile the program:** `Makefile` is included and it automatically handle the compilation for you. After compiling, you will get the executable `minishell`. To compile the program, run:

```bash
make
```

3. **Clean and recompile:** 
- If you want to remove temporary files created during compilation, you can run: `make clean`
- If you want to clean up everything, including the executable and object files, please run: `make fclean`
- If you want to force a full recompilation by cleaning up and then recompiling, you can use: `make re`

## Operating instructions

### How can I execute the program?

Run `./minishell` without arguments.

## Project status

This project was submitted to peer-evaluations and completed. 

## General information

### Lessons learned from the project

- We improved our knowledge of process management, file descriptors, and, of course, shell functionalities.
- We gained experience in constructing and managing abstract syntax trees to effectively parse complex command chains.
- We developed the ability to create and manage child processes, enabling the execution of multiple commands in sequence.
